# Machine Learning Sample Model

This repository contains a sample machine learning model designed to demonstrate basic concepts and workflows in machine learning. It is intended for educational purposes and can be used as a starting point for building more complex models.

## Features

- Preprocessed dataset for training and testing.
- Implementation of a simple machine learning algorithm.
- Code for training, evaluation, and prediction.
- Easy-to-follow structure for beginners.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - Scikit-learn
    - Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sample-ml-model.git
     cd sample-ml-model
     ```

2. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```

4. Evaluate the model:
     ```bash
     python evaluate.py
     ```

5. Use the model for predictions:
     ```bash
     python predict.py --input your_input_data.csv
     ```

## File Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Stores trained models.
- `train.py`: Script for training the model.
- `evaluate.py`: Script for evaluating the model.
- `predict.py`: Script for making predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
